h1. grailsEvents

The [grailsEvents|guide:events] bean is an instance of
[Events|api:org.grails.plugin.platform.events.Events] that provides access to the
generic events bus features of the platform.

The implementation itself delegates much of the functionality to
@grailsEventsPublisher@ and @grailsEventsRegistry@ beans provided by any events bus plugins that are installed.
