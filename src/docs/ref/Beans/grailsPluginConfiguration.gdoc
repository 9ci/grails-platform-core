The grailsPluginConfiguration bean is responsible for merging plugin
evaluating the configuration options DSL and merging configurations from
plugins with the application's configuration.

Normally you will not need to access this bean, but you may want need to
object the relevant plugin Config data for an artefact defined by a plugin -
to do so you can call @getPluginConfigFor(objectInstance)@ and you will
receive the ConfigObject if any.
