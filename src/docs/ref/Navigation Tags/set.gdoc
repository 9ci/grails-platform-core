h1. nav:set

h2. Purpose

You can call this tag from inside a controller or GSP if you need to "fudge" the current request's activation path. This is only necessary if there is no controller/action available on the current request, or if you need to simulate navigation while ignoring the real current activation path.

You may need to do this inside an error.gsp for example.

h2. Example

{code:xml}
<html>
<body>
    <!-- pretend we are in support/error even though we are in a GSP with no controller -->
    <nav:setActivePath path="app/support/error"/>

    <nav:primary/>
    <nav:secondary/>

    <p>Something went wrong!</p>
</body>
</html>
{code}
