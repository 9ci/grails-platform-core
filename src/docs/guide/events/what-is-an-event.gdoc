An event is often as simple as a "callback" with no parameters, but usually there is some extra state passed as an event object.

An event can be sent to multiple listeners, and any result returned from any listeners is passed back to the original sender of the event.

An event belongs to a "topic" and often has a "subject". The topic is like a channel that identifies the kind or scope of events. The optional subject is the object that the event "happened to".

So for example a simple "app started" notification has no subject but may have topic "grails", but a "user logged in" even may have topic "security" and subject set to the user principal supplied by the security plugin you are using.

When sending or listening for events you indicate the topic and subject.
